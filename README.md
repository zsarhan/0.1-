## About Us

In today’s fast-paced world, even a tiny 0.1% shift in mood can transform your entire day. At 0.1 Café, we believe that a simple cup of coffee can spark that small but powerful change — a warm moment of calm that refreshes your mind and uplifts your spirit.

0.1 Café is more than just a coffee shop; it’s a sanctuary for those seeking a brief pause, a moment of peace amidst daily chaos. Every cup we serve embodies this philosophy, inviting you to slow down and embrace the power of small moments.
